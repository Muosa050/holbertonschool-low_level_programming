#Singly Linked List
==================

##Shape
-----
A node contains two parts:
- A cell that holds the data
- A cell that holds the address of the next node

##Searching
---------
Traversal happens forward, node by node.

##Inserting
---------
Easy to insert into the list.
No need to shift elements.

##Deletion
--------
Nodes can be deleted directly.

##Creation
--------
- First, create a structure for the node (data and next pointer).
- Then use this structure to insert your elements into the list.
